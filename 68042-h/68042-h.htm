<h3 class="h3head">SCENES IN THE CITY PRISON OF NEW YORK.</h3>

<p class="center">STEPHEN DOWNING.</p>

<p class="p2">This man was arrested as a fugitive, by a Virginia planter, and imprisoned
in Bridewell, where he remained eighteen months. The inmates
of the prison knew him well, and they were always ready to
speak a good word for Downing. After the planter had got his <em>legal</em>
right allowed, either because his lawyer’s bill was so heavy, or because
he hoped Downing’s friends would <em>buy</em> him, he neglected to take him
away for three months. By this delay he forfeited his right to do so,
as was decided by Judge Edwards. But Downing’s release was referred
to the Supreme Court, which was to meet in two weeks. To the
disappointment of every body, this was prevented by another
<em>Judge</em>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span>
who, contrary to his promise, secretly wrote for, and by a partial
statement, obtained from the Supreme Court, at Albany, an order for
the removal of poor Downing, and, before his friends were aware of
the plot, <em>he was shipped for Virginia</em>.</p>

<p>Here we see intrigue and perfidy used with impunity to deprive
this poor man of his liberty, which, had it been used in the case of a
dog, would have consigned its perpetrators to remediless disgrace.&mdash;&#8203;Such
is the strength of <em>a pro-slavery public</em> sentiment!</p>

<p class="p2 center">FRANCIS SMITH</p>

<p class="p2">Was a young man of small stature, but of keen eye and intelligent
countenance. While a lad, in the time of the last war, he
and his master were taken prisoners at sea and carried to Nova
Scotia. His servile condition becoming known to the British officers,
they compelled his master to give him free papers. But when
the prisoners were exchanged, his master persuaded him to return
with him to Virginia, by the promise that he should still be free.
But he was sold. In Richmond he for some years had hired his
time, and kept a well known fruit shop. At last he became the
marriage portion of his master’s daughter, and was speedily to be
removed as part and parcel of the <em>set out</em> of the bride. To this he
demurred, threw himself upon his inalienable rights, and came to
New York. Here he occupied himself for some months as a waiter,
much to the satisfaction of his employer. The object of his
affections, a very worthy and industrious free colored girl, had
found her way to New Haven, Connecticut. Thither it was fixed
that Francis should follow, and after their marriage they should
proceed with their united means to a place of greater safety. But
the kind Christian <em>white</em> bridegroom had come on from Virginia to
search for his runaway <em>property</em>, and by the aid of a professed slave
taker in the city, discovered the retreat of Francis and his intended
movements. At the appointed hour for the steamboat to start, the
colored young man came quietly on board with his little bundle.
The fell tigers were in ambush&mdash;&#8203;the slave-taker Boudinot, a
constable, and the lily-fingered white bridegroom aforesaid. The
latter delicately pointed at the victim. A pounce was made upon
him by Boudinot. Smith, after a scuffle of a moment, in which his
antagonist received a scratch from his knife, darted on shore, cried
“kidnappers,” and fled. The pursuers raised the cry of “murderer,
stop the murderer.” The crowd thus deceived ran after him.
Clubs, stones, and brickbats, were hurled at the poor fugitive without
mercy, and he was at last brought to the ground, weltering in
his blood. The owner took care to save his “property” from farther
injury by having it conveyed to the old Bridewell. Thus was
the happiness of this humble pair frustrated, that the delicate fingers
of another pair might be spared the vulgar necessity of doing
something for the support of their owners. And all this was done
by law. During the law’s delay, Francis for months occupied one
of the coffin cells, the heat and smothering stench of which, added
to his disappointment and his galling manacles, were too much for
his brain. Often were his wild ravings heard by the passengers
on the outside.</p>

<p>His intended bride, in the bitterness of her grief and disappointment,
offered her little all, amounting to about $300, for his ransom,
but it was of no avail.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">SLAVERY A SIN.</h3>

<p class="center smaller">[From the Declaration of Sentiments of the Ohio Anti-Slavery Convention.]</p>

<p class="p2">We believe slavery to be a sin&mdash;&#8203;always, every where, and only
sin. Sin in itself, apart from the occasional rigors incidental to its
administration, and from all those perils, liabilities, and positive
inflictions to which its victims are continually exposed, sin in the
nature of the act which creates it, and in the elements which constitute
it. Sin, because it converts persons into things; makes men
property, God’s image, merchandise. Because it forbids men to
use themselves for the advancement of their own well being, and
turns them into mere instruments to be used by others solely for
the benefit of the users. Because it constitutes one man the owner
of the body, soul, and spirit of other men&mdash;&#8203;gives him power and
permission to make his own pecuniary profit the great end of their
being, thus striking them out of existence as beings possessing
rights and susceptibilities of happiness, and forcing them to exist
merely as appendages to his own existence. In other words, because
slavery <em>holds and uses men, as mere means for the accomplishment
of ends, of which ends their own interests are not a part</em>,&mdash;&#8203;thus
annihilating the sacred and eternal distinction between a person
and a thing, a distinction proclaimed an axiom by all human consciousness&mdash;&#8203;a
distinction created by God,&mdash;&#8203;crowned with glory and
honor in the attributes of intelligence, morality, accountability and
immortal existence, and commended to the homage of universal
mind, by the concurrent testimony of nature, conscience, providence,
and revelation, by the blood of atonement and the sanctions
of eternity, authenticated by the seal of Deity, and in its own nature,
effaceless and immutable. This distinction, slavery contemns, disannuls,
and tramples under foot. This is its fundamental element,&mdash;&#8203;its
vital constituent principle, that which makes it a sin <em>in itself</em>
under whatever modification existing. All the incidental effects of
the system flow spontaneously from this fountain-head. The constant
exposure of slaves to outage, and the actual inflictions which
they experience in innumerable forms, all result legitimately from
this principle, assumed in the theory and embodied in the practice
of slave holding.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">THE KIDNAPPED GIRL.</h3>

<p class="p2">That our readers may know familiarly the horrors of the American
“Middle passage,” we extract from the report on the free colored
population of Ohio the case of Mary Brown. Let the dainty
sentimentalists, who tremble to approach the “delicate” subject, stand
off; but if there are any who wish to help their suffering fellow
creatures, let them come and look at the naked ugliness of <em>things
as they are</em>, till they feel something like an honest and <em>practical</em> indignation
against the whole system of man-driving.</p>

<p>“Mary Brown, another colored girl who was kidnapped in
1830, was the daughter of free parents in Washington city. She
lived with her parents until the death of her mother; she was then
seized and sold. The following are the facts as she stated them.
One day when near the Potomac bridge, Mr. Humphreys, the sheriff,
overtook her, and told her that she must go with him.&mdash;&#8203;She
inquired of him, what for? He made no reply, but told her to
come along. He took her immediately to a slave auction. Mary
told Mr. Humphreys that she was free, but he contradicted her,
and the sale went on. The auctioneer soon found a purchaser, and
struck her off for three hundred and fifty dollars. Her master was
a Mississippi trader, and she was immediately taken to the jail.
After a few hours, Mary was handcuffed&mdash;&#8203;chained to a man slave,
and started in a drove of about forty for New Orleans. Her handcuffs
made her wrists swell so that they were obliged to take them
off at night, and put fetters on her ankles. In the morning her
handcuffs were again put on. Thus they travelled for two weeks,
wading rivers, and whipped up all day, and beaten at night, if they
did not get their distance. Mary says that she frequently waded
rivers in her chains with water up to her waist. It was in October,
and the weather cold and frosty. After traveling thus twelve or
fifteen days, her arms and ankles became so swollen that she felt
that she could go no farther. Blisters would form on her feet as
large as dollars, which at night she would have to open, while all
day the shackles would cut into her lacerated wrists. They had
no beds, and usually slept in barns, or out on the naked ground&mdash;&#8203;was
in such misery when she lay down that she could only lie and
cry all night. Still they drove them on for another week. Her
spirits became so depressed, and she grieved so much about leaving
her friends, that she could not eat, and every time the trader caught
her crying, he would beat her, accompanying it with dreadful
curses. The trader would whip and curse any of them whom he
found praying. One evening he caught one of the men at prayer&mdash;&#8203;he
took him, lashed him down to a parcel of rails, and beat him
dreadfully. He told Mary that if he caught her praying he would
give her Hell!! (Mary was a member of the Methodist Church
in Washington.) There were a number of pious people in the company,
and at night when the driver found them melancholy, and
disposed to pray, he would have a fiddle brought, and make them
dance in their chains. It mattered not how sad or weary they
were, he would whip them until they <em>would</em> do it.</p>

<p>“Mary at length became so weak that she could travel no further.
Her feeble frame, was exhausted and sunk beneath her accumulated
sufferings. She was seized with a burning fever, and the
trader, fearing he should lose her, carried her the remainder of
the way in a wagon.</p>

<p>“When they arrived at Natchez, they were all offered for sale,
and as Mary was still sick, she begged that she might be sold to a
kind master. She would sometimes make this request in presence
of purchasers&mdash;&#8203;but was always insulted for it, and after they were
gone, the trader would punish her for such presumption. On one
occasion he tied her up by her hands, so that she could only touch
the end of her toes to the floor. This was soon after breakfast; he
kept her thus suspended, whipping her at intervals through the
day&mdash;&#8203;at evening he took her down. She was so much bruised, that
she could not lie down for more than a week afterwards. He often
beat and choked her for another purpose, until she was obliged to
yield to his desires.</p>

<p>“She was at length sold to a wealthy man of Vicksburg at four
hundred and fifty dollars, for a house servant. But he had another
object in view. He compelled her to gratify his licentious passions
and had children by her. This was the occasion of so much difficulty
between him and his wife, that he has now sent her up to
Cincinnati to be free.</p>

<p>“We have no reason to doubt the account of Mary as given above.
The person from whom we heard this took it down from her own
lips. Her manner of relating it was perfectly simple and artless,
and is here written out almost verbatim. We have also the testimony
of a number of individuals who knew her in Vicksburg;
they have no doubt of her integrity, and say that we may rely implicitly
upon the truth of any statement which she may make.”</p>

<hr />

<h3 class="h3head">HELPING TO BUY A FATHER.</h3>

<p class="center smaller">[From a Report on the Free Colored Population of Ohio.]</p>

<p class="p2">“Calling upon a family not long since, whose children did not
come to school very regularly, we found the father and mother
were out at work. On saying to the eldest child, aged about ten
years, “why dont you come to school, my girl?” she replied, “I’m
staying at home to help buy father.”</p>

<p>“As this family attend the sabbath school, we will state some particulars
respecting them, to illustrate a general fact. Their history
is, by no means, a remarkable one. Conversing with them one
day, they remarked: “We have been wonderfully blessed; not one
in a hundred is treated so well as we have been.” A few years
since, the mother, an amiable woman, intelligent, pious, and beloved
by all who knew her, was emancipated. But she lived in
continual dread lest her husband, who was still a slave, should be
sold and separated from her forever. After much painful solicitation,
his master permitted him to come to Cincinnati, to work out
his freedom. Although under no obligation, except his verbal
promise, he is now, besides supporting a sickly family, saving from
his daily wages the means of paying the price of his body. The
money is sent to a nephew of his master, who is now studying for
the ministry, in Miami University. The following is an extract
from the correspondence of this candidate for the ministry. It is
addressed to this colored man.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="unindent">“Mr. <span class="sc">Overton</span>:</p>

<p>Sir, I have an order on you for $150, from your old master. It is in consideration
of your dues to him for your freedom. I am in great want of the money,
and have been for some time. I shall only ask you 10 per cent interest, although
12 is common. The money has been due two months. If you cannot pay it before
the last of March, I shall have to return the order to Uncle Jo,&mdash;&#8203;for I cannot
wait longer than that time. It must also run at 12 per cent interest henceforth.
If you cannot pay it all, write to me, and let me know when you can. Uncle Jo
requests me to let him know when you would have any more money for him.</p>

<p class="quotesig">Yours in haste.”</p>

</div><!--end blockquote-->

<p>“This is only one of a series of dunning letters which came every
few weeks. Soon after the reception of this, Mr. Overton scraped
together the pittance he had earned, and sent the young man $100,
with interest. And he is now going out at days work, and his wife,
when able, is taking in washing, to pay the balance.”</p>

<hr />

<h3 class="h3head">THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY.</h3>

<p class="p2">We have heard the claim that some men are <em>born slaves</em>, but
from the following fact we see that the all-grasping genius of slavery
is not always contented to wait for birth. It claims a right of
property in men <span class="sc">BEFORE</span> <em>they are born</em>.</p>

<p>“Another individual had bargained for his wife and two children.
Their master agreed to take $420 for them. He succeeded at
length in raising the money, which he carried to their owner. ‘I
shall charge you $30 more than when you was here before,’ said
the planter, ‘for your wife is in a family-way, and you may pay
thirty dollars for that, or not take her, just as you please.’ ‘And
so,’ said he, (patting the head of a little son three years old, who
hung upon his knee,) ‘I had to pay thirty dollars for this little fellow,
six months before he was born.’”&mdash;&#8203;<cite>Ohio Report.</cite></p>

<hr />

<h3 class="h3head">WHAT COLONIZATION MEANS.</h3>

<p class="p2">Our colored brethren have always understood that colonization
means expatriation, a cruel driving out of the country. And it is
remarkable how few of them, by all the art, and argument, and
benevolence too, of the colonization community, have been persuaded
to embrace the scheme. An old colored woman, who had
been most of her life a slave in Virginia, said to the writer of this,
when he spoke to her of the bright prospects of Liberia, “Ah, sir,
if it’s going to be so good a place, the white folks will come and
take it, by and by. I know them well enough. They always take
what’s best.” It is needless to say that this woman could not be
convinced of the benevolence of colonization. It is not to be denied
by any body, that there is in this country a very general hatred of
the colored people. And it might have been predicted with certainty,
that any plan for their general removal, however benevolent
its motive, and however careful it might be to act only by their <em>own
consent</em>, would bring into life and action a general desire to <em>drive
them out</em>. Such has been the fact in regard to the American Colonization
Society. We have abundance of proof, but at present
have only room for the following.</p>

<p><cite>Extract from the Maryland Temperance Herald, of May 30, 1835.</cite>
“We are indebted to the committee of publication, for the first
number of the Maryland Colonization Journal, a new quarterly periodical,
devoted to the cause of colonization in our state. Such a
paper has long been necessary; we hope this will be useful.</p>

<p>“Every reflecting man must be convinced, that the time is not
far distant when the safety of the country will require the EXPULSION
of the blacks from its limits.&mdash;&#8203;It is perfect folly to suppose
that a foreign population, whose physical peculiarities must forever
render them distinct from the owners of the soil, can be permitted
to grow and strengthen among us with impunity. Let hair-brained
enthusiasts speculate as they may, no abstract considerations of the
natural rights of man will ever elevate the negro population to an
equality with the whites. As long as they remain in the land of
their bondage, they will be morally, if not physically, enslaved, and
indeed, as long as their distinct nationality is preserved, their <em>enlightenment</em>
will be a measure of <em>doubtful policy</em>. Under such circumstances,
every philanthropist will wish to see them removed,
but gradually, and with as little violence as possible. For effecting
this purpose, no scheme is liable to so few objections as that of African
Colonization. It has been said that this plan has effected but
little&mdash;&#8203;true, but no other has done any thing. We do not expect
that the exertions of benevolent individuals will be able to rid us
of the millions of blacks who oppress and are oppressed by us. All
they can accomplish, is, to satify the public of the practicability of
the scheme&mdash;&#8203;they can make the experiment&mdash;&#8203;they are making it,
and with success. The state of Maryland has already adopted this
plan, and before long, every southern state will have its colony.
The whole African coast will be strewn with cities, and then
should some fearful convulsion render it necessary to the public
safety TO BANISH THE MULTITUDE AT ONCE, a house
of refuge will have been provided for them in the land of their fathers.”</p>

<p>At a convention of gradualists and colonizationists, held on the
23d of May, 1835, at Shelbyville, Kentucky, the following resolutions
were passed.</p>

<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That the system of domestic slavery, as it exists in
this commonwealth, is both a moral and political evil, and a violation
of the natural rights of man.</p>

<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That no system of emancipation will meet with our
approbation, unless colonization be inseparably connected with it;
and that any scheme of emancipation which shall leave the blacks
within our borders, is more to be deprecated than slavery itself.”</p>

<p>So the only condition on which the slaves are to be emancipated
is <em>exile</em>. This is no emancipation at all. For if a man is free, he
must be free to stay in the land of his birth. The plain meaning
of these resolutions is, that the resolvers are so bent upon expatriating
their poor colored laborers, that they rush on to a “violation
of the natural rights of man” to effect their purpose. Would it be
any worse in principle to free the slaves by cutting their throats?
And again, is it not wrong to advocate a scheme which gives the
least countenance to such iniquity?</p>

<p>At the anniversaries in New Hampshire, the Rev. R. R. Gurley,
secretary of the American Colonization Society, being called upon
by Mr. May to give his opinion concerning the Maryland scheme,
gave utterance to the following remarkable sentiment. With regard
to direct legislation he would confess his mind was not clear.
This he would say, on his own responsibility, that when the time
arrived that slavery should become a great political question, he
conceived it might be justifiable for a state to select a spot, <em>here or
in Africa, and carry the blacks there, willing or unwilling</em>. But he
should object to the Maryland scheme, because, <em>at the present time</em>,
such rigorous laws were unnecessary.</p>

<p>Here is a sentiment as <em>murderous</em> to the peace of the colored
people as a dagger thrust into the heart.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">ANTI-SLAVERY MEETINGS IN PITTSBURGH.</h3>

<p class="p2">There have recently been two most interesting anti-slavery
meetings in Pittsburgh, which were addressed by a number of
members of the Presbyterian General Assembly. In this connection,
we have the pleasure to state, that <em>forty-eight</em> members, or
about <em>one</em> fourth part of that body, this year, were found to be favorable
to <em>immediate emancipation</em>: of these, <em>six</em> are ministers from
<em>slave states</em>. Last year there were only <em>two</em> known abolitionists in
the Assembly. The speeches at the anti-slavery meetings were
Christian-like, eloquent, and rich in facts. We make a few extracts.</p>

<p class="p2 center">FROM THE REV. DR. BEMAN OF TROY.</p>

<p>“Admitting, as all do, that slavery is a great evil, existing in the
land, we would anxiously inquire, Is there no remedy? Is there
any evil for which God has provided no remedy? No, I would
not slander the Bible, by making such an assertion. Let us all
come up to the work, shoulder to shoulder, in a pleasant way, (I
don’t like scowls,) and there is no danger but we can get right. I
have heard many remedies proposed; and one very queer one:
‘<cite>Better let it alone.</cite>’ This is a very popular remedy. In case of
slight pain, or momentary head-ach, it will do very well. But who
ever heard that an acute disease, which racks the whole frame,
and threatens speedy dissolution, if left to the operations of nature,
will cure itself? Sin is an inveterate disease&mdash;&#8203;it has no curative
principle&mdash;&#8203;it never gets well of itself. Slavery will never cure itself.&mdash;&#8203;This
<em>let-alone</em> policy&mdash;&#8203;if it were in the church, I would call
it <em>heresy</em>&mdash;&#8203;it is <em>moral</em> heresy.</p>

<p>“But, I have heard of another remedy: ‘Just leave that question
to the slave states. What have we at the north to do with slavery?’
But, here is ground for caution. Have not we at the north
our share in the government of the District of Columbia? Do we
not in fact govern it? Yet, that district is the central mart of the
traffic in human flesh. Yes, sir, we at the north do govern slave
shambles. Our hands are not quite so clean as we have supposed&mdash;&#8203;as
in the dusty atmosphere of Pittsburgh, we often get them a
little smutty before we are aware of it.</p>

<p>“My southern brethren never heard me slander them. I am
candid on this subject. Often do we hear it said, ‘What do northern
people know about slavery?’ Sir, I am not a stranger to slavery.
I have resided eleven years at the south, and three or four
winters into the bargain, and I know something about it. It is an
immense evil. I can go, chapter and verse, with the able document
that has been read.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>
It is even so&mdash;&#8203;the very picture of slavery.
Are our southern brethren infallible? They are very kind-hearted
brethren; yet some of them SELL THE IMAGE OF JESUS IN
THEIR SLAVES! Are they competent judges in the case?&mdash;&#8203;The
wise man says, ‘A gift blindeth the eyes.’ They judge with
the price of human flesh in their hands.”</p>

<p class="p2 center">FROM REV. A. RANKIN OF OHIO.</p>

<p>Mr. Rankin is brother to Rev. John Rankin, author of “Letters
on Slavery,” and is, if we mistake not, by birth a southern man.</p>

<p>“But we are told, ‘You at the north know nothing of slavery&mdash;&#8203;why
meddle with what you do not understand?’ Sir, we do know
what slavery is. It is usurped authority&mdash;&#8203;a system of legalized
oppression. If we could show what is this moment transpiring in
the land of slavery, every bosom in this house would thrill with
horror. I will state a case: A minister of the gospel owned a female
slave, whose husband was owned by another man in the same
neighborhood. The husband did something supposed to be an offence
sufficient to justify his master in selling him for the southern
market. As he started, his wife obtained leave to visit him. She
took her final leave of him, and started to return to her master’s
house. She went a few steps, and returned and embraced him
again, and then started the second time to go to her master’s house;
but the feelings of her heart overcame her, and she turned about
and embraced him the third time. Again she endeavoured to bear
up under the heavy trial, and return; but it was too much for her&mdash;&#8203;she
had a woman’s heart. She returned the fourth time, embraced
her husband, and turned about&mdash;&#8203;<span class="sc">A MANIAC</span>. To judge what
slavery is, we must place ourselves in the condition of the slave.
Who that has a wife, who that has a husband, could endure for a
moment the thought of <em>such a separation</em>! Take another case: A
company of slave dealers were passing through Louisville with a
drove of slaves, of all classes and descriptions. Among them were
many mothers with infants in their arms. These often become
troublesome to the drivers: and in this case, in order to get rid of
the trouble, the inhuman monsters severed the cords of maternal
affection, and took these infants, from three to five months old, and
sold them in the streets of Louisville, for what they could get. Do
we know nothing of slavery? Can we shut our eyes to such facts
as these, which are constantly staring us in the face?”</p>

<p class="p2 footnote"> <a name="footnote_2" id="footnote_2"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_2"><span class="muchsmaller">[2]</span></a>
 The Declaration of the Ohio Anti-Slavery Convention.</p>

<p class="p2 center">FROM REV. MR. BOARDMAN OF N. Y.</p>

<p>Mr. Boardman directed his address especially to ladies, and we
should think not without effect. He said:</p>

<p>“In slavery, marriage is unknown. Men and women live together:
but the tie is not formally sanctioned. There is no minister,
no magistrate, to give religious or civil authority to the relation.
It is a system of concubinage. And this state of things is
encouraged, or rather marriage is discouraged, because it throws
an obstacle in the way of the sale of these <em>human chattels</em>. Notwithstanding,
the ties of affection are not less strong on account of
the absence of legal or religious sanction. Indeed, the fellowship
of suffering binds still stronger the hearts of husband and wife. It
is the only channel of affection. The children of the slave are not
his own&mdash;&#8203;they are not subject to his authority, and they may be
torn from him without a moment’s warning. Pent up in every
other direction, the affections of husband and wife naturally centre
entirely upon each other. Yet, even this tie is rudely severed. A
slave in the west, who had a wife belonging to another master,
learned, to his great grief, that his wife had been sold for the
southern market. He went to his master, and requested that he
might be sold, so as not to be separated from his wife. In order to
dissuade him from it, his master described the hardships to which
he would be exposed in the south; but he was firm to his purpose,
choosing the severe servitude of the sugar plantations of the south,
in preference to a separation from the wife of his bosom. His master
then offered him money to satisfy him; but no, he said he could
not leave his wife. ‘O,’ says his master, ‘You can get another!’
‘Why, massa, don’t you think I am a man!’</p>

<p>“Another case, I will mention, to show the legitimate effects of
slavery upon the relations of life. A colored man, who was a
member of the church, and who had been living with a woman,
according to the customs of the slaves, went to his master, who was
an <em>elder in the</em> Presbyterian church, and told him that he did not
feel right to be living so, and requested permission to be lawfully
married. And, how do you suppose this reasonable request was
received? Although it was a request from one Christian brother
to another to be permitted to cease from sin, yet it was received
with a laugh, and positively denied.</p>

<p>“It is in behalf of woman, to woman that this appeal is made,
It is woman in bondage that calls for woman’s sympathies, woman’s
efforts, and woman’s prayers. And I feel confident that this appeal
will not meet a cold repulse, because the object of it has a black
skin. I remember, in my boyhood, of seeing a colored man driving
a cart, and by some accident he was precipitated from his seat, and
crushed to death. But when the alarm began to spread, I heard it
said, ‘O, its only a poor negro that is killed.’ But O, thought I, it
is a man. And, boy as I was, I remembered that he had an immortal
soul. Ah, think you woman would have said that? No.
Woman has a heart that can be moved with the sufferings of the
poor negro.</p>

<p>“Woman did much for the abolition of slavery in Great Britain
and her dependencies. When the petition was presented to parliament,
it required four men to carry it to the speaker’s desk. It
was signed by 182,000 ladies. A noble lord arose, and with much
emotion, said, ‘It is time for us to move in this matter, when we
are called upon in this manner by our wives, and sisters, and mothers!’
And I rejoice that the ladies of this country are already
lifting up their voices on this subject. Sir, I was much gratified
to hear the voice of 1,000 of my countrywomen raised in the General
Assembly, in behalf of suffering humanity. And, I feel assured
that woman’s voice will be heard. But, if man will not hear, there
is an audience where you can appear with the assurance of being
heard. O, then, mothers, sisters, wives, let your voice be heard at
the throne of grace, pleading in behalf of your enslaved sisters,
and of suffering bondmen.</p>

<p>“But, the question is asked and reiterated, ‘What has abolition
done?’ What has abolition done! It has done much, sir. It has
so modified the sentiments of many colonizationists that they speak
a language in reference to slavery, which would not have been tolerated
in 1830. Its voice is now heard in Maryland, in Kentucky,
in Tennessee, in Missouri&mdash;&#8203;in some places, indeed, it is feeble&mdash;&#8203;in
others it is the voice of thunder. What has abolition done? On
the first day of August, 1834, it broke the manacles of 800,000
slaves. The sun set upon them in bondage, and rose upon them
in freedom.”</p>

<p class="p2 center">FROM REV. MR. DICKEY OF OHIO.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Mr. D., “I am not ignorant of slavery. Having
passed thirty years of my life in a slave state, and having been a
slave-holder myself, I know something about it.</p>

<p>“Slavery in the church exposes her to the scoffs of the world.
Infidels despise a religion which they suppose sanctions such oppression.
I once heard a professor of religion laboring to justify
slavery from the Bible, in the presence of an infidel; who turned
from him with contempt, saying he despised such a religion.</p>

<p>“It exerts an influence upon the mind of the slave, prejudicial
to the reception of instruction. Suppose the master himself attempt
to instruct his slaves in the truths of religion&mdash;&#8203;what confidence
can he have in the man, who deprives him of his liberty, and
robs him of his labor? I will state a case: An old slave told me,
“Massa bery ’ligious&mdash;&#8203;he bery good Christian. He hab prayers
e’vry Sunday wid the slaves&mdash;&#8203;but he sure to read ’em dat chapter
what say servants be ’bedient to massa.”</p>

<p>This book was written in a period when many words had not become
standardized in their spelling. Words may have multiple spelling
variations or inconsistent hyphenation in the text. These have been
left unchanged unless indicated below. Misspelled words were not
corrected.</p>

<p>The page number in the caption to the illustration on the title
page refers to an earlier issue.</p>

<p>Footnotes were numbered sequentially and moved to the end of the
section in which the anchor occurs. Obvious printing errors, such as
backwards, upside down, or partially printed letters, were corrected.
An open quote was changed from single to double in the blockquote;
unprinted commas in the lists of receipts were added for consistency.</p>

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
